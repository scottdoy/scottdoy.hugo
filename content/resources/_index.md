<p><em>
A lot of information is available on the Internet for the kinds of research we do, but much of it is disconnected, redundant, or out-of-date. 
This page reflects my attempts to collect useful tools, tutorials, and resources in one place.

<p>
Python is one of the <em>default</em> languages for people working in Machine Learning or Data Science. 
Information on how to get started learning Python can be found <a href="https://github.com/scottdoy/doyle_lab/blob/master/notes/programming-python.org>">here</a>.
This page will be updated in the near future to a more comprehensive, self-contained tutorial.
In the meanwhile, browse that page for information on how to begin.

<h4><a href="https://github.com">Git / GitHub</a></h4>
<p>
For some reason, version control and cloud-based backups are not fundamental skills taught to all undergraduates. 
Until this gets rectified, check out <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git-scm.com</a> for a great overview of how version control works and what makes git unique.
In particular, the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git</a> book is a comprehensive tome on the subject.
If you read and understand through <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell">Chapter 3: "Git Branching"</a>, you will know everything you need to use Git effectively.
"Git" is the version control software, while "GitHub" is an online service (recently acquired by Microsoft) that hosts git repositories. 
The service is free to use for anyone, but the free accounts only allow a single private repository. 
Academics can qualify free private repositories if you sign up through your institutional e-mail, so make sure you take advantage of this if you are able.
