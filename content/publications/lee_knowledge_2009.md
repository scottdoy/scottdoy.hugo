The demand for personalized health care requires a wide range of diagnostic tools for determining patient prognosis and theragnosis (response to treatment). These tools present us with data that is both multi-modal (imaging and non-imaging) and multi-scale (proteomics, histology). By utilizing the information in these sources concurrently, we expect significant improvement in predicting patient prognosis and theragnosis. However, a prerequisite to realizing this improvement is the ability to effectively and quantitatively combine information from disparate sources. In this paper, we present a general fusion framework (GFF) aimed towards a combined knowledge representation predicting disease recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, GFF represents the first formal attempt to fuse biomedical image and non-image information directly at the data level as opposed to the decision level, thus preserving more subtle contributions in the original data. GFF represents the different data streams in separate embedding spaces via the application of dimensionality reduction (DR). Data fusion is then implemented by combining the individual reduced embedding spaces. A proof of concept example is considered for evaluating the GFF, whereby protein expression measurements from mass spectrometry are combined with histological image signatures to predict prostate cancer (CaP) recurrence in 6 CaP patients, following therapy. Preliminary results suggest that GFF offers an intelligent way to fuse image and non-image data structures for making prognostic and theragnostic predictions.
