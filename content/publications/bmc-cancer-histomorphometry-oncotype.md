**Background**: Gene-expression companion diagnostic tests, such as the Oncotype
DX test, assess the risk of early stage Estrogen receptor (ER) positive (+)
breast cancers, and guide clinicians in the decision of whether or not to use
chemotherapy. However, these tests are typically expensive, time consuming, and
tissue-destructive.

**Methods**: In this paper, we evaluate the ability of computer-extracted
nuclear morphology features from routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained
images of 178 early stage ER+ breast cancer patients to predict corresponding
risk categories derived using the Oncotype DX test. A total of 216 features
corresponding to the nuclear shape and architecture categories from each of the
pathologic images were extracted and four feature selection schemes: Ranksum,
Principal Component Analysis with Variable Importance on Projection (PCA-VIP),
Maximum-Relevance, Minimum Redundancy Mutual Information Difference (MRMR MID),
and Maximum-Relevance, Minimum Redundancy - Mutual Information Quotient (MRMR
MIQ), were employed to identify the most discriminating features. These
features were employed to train 4 machine learning classifiers: Random Forest,
Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Linear Discriminant Analysis, via
3-fold cross validation.

**Results**: The four sets of risk categories, and the top Area Under the
receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) machine classifier performances
were: 1) Low ODx and Low mBR grade vs. High ODx and High mBR grade (Low-Low vs.
High-High) (AUC=0.83), 2) Low ODx vs. High ODx (AUC=0.72), 3) Low ODx vs.
Intermediate and High ODx (AUC=0.58), and 4) Low and Intermediate ODx vs. High
ODx (AUC=0.65). Trained models were tested independent validation set of 53
cases which comprised of Low and High ODx risk, and demonstrated per-patient
accuracies ranging from 75-86%.

**Conclusion**: Our results suggest that computerized image analysis of
digitized H&E pathology images of early stage ER+ breast cancer might be able
predict the corresponding Oncotype DX risk categories.
