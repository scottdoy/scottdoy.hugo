Automated classification of histopathology involves identification of multiple
classes, including benign, cancerous, and confounder categories. The confounder
tissue classes can often mimic and share attributes with both the diseased and
normal tissue classes, and can be particularly difficult to identify, both
manually and by automated classifiers. In the case of prostate cancer, they may
be several confounding tissue types present in a biopsy sample, posing as major
sources of diagnostic error for pathologists. Two common multi-class approaches
are one-shot classification (OSC), where all classes are identified
simultaneously, and one-versus-all (OVA), where a "target” class is
distinguished from all "non-target” classes. OSC is typically unable to handle
discrimination of classes of varying similarity (e.g. with images of prostate
atrophy and high grade cancer), while OVA forces several heterogeneous classes
into a single "non-target” class. In this work, we present a cascaded (CAS)
approach to classifying prostate biopsy tissue samples, where images from
different classes are grouped to maximize intra-group homogeneity while
maximizing inter-group heterogeneity.
