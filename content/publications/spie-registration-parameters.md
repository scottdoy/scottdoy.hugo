Patients diagnosed with early stage (Stage I/II) Oral Cavity Cancer (OCC) are
typically treated with surgery alone. Unfortunately, 25-37% of early stage OCC
patients experience loco-regional tumor recurrence after receiving surgery.
Currently, pathologists use the Histologic Risk Model (HRM), a clinically
validated risk assessment tool to determine patient prognosis. In this study, we
perform image registration on two cases of serially sectioned blocks of
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H and E) stained OCC tissue sections. The goal of this
work is to create an optimized registration procedure to reconstruct 3D tissue
models, which can provide a pathologist with a realistic representation of the
tissue architecture before surgical resection. Our project aims to extend the
HRM to enhance prediction performance for patients at high risk of disease
progression using computational pathology tools. In previous literature, others
have explored image registration of histological slides and reconstructing 3D
models with similar processes used. Our work is unique in that we are
investigating in-depth the parameter space of an image registration algorithm to
establish a registration procedure for any serial histological section. Each
parameter set was sequentially perturbed to determine the best parameter set for
registration, as evaluated through mutual information.
