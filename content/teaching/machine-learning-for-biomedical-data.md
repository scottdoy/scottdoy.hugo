A technical introduction to pattern classification and machine learning,
focusing on biomedical data.

<!--more-->

Students will learn the details of classical and modern machine learning
approaches and when to apply them. We will focus on applications to biomedical
problems, including quantification, disease diagnosis, patient classification,
and decision support systems.

The lecture material will be a mix of theory and application, with both lecture
notes and in-class demos used to describe the concepts behind each of the
algorithms we will discuss. The goal is for students to feel confident in
selecting and applying machine learning algorithms to problems in biomedical
engineering.
