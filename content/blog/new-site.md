Ahoy!

This is my newly re-designed website, to collect things of interest in my
professional life. Expect to see blog posts, code, advice, fluff, and some
actual research to go into these pages. My hope is for this site to act as a
"notebook" of sorts, collecting all the little bits and bobs I find across
the internet that help me work.

Site design stolen wholesale from [Kieran Healy](https://kieranhealy.org),
who graciously posted his template. I made some minor modifications, and will
continue to do so, but the initial design is all his.
